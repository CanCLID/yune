## What Yune Does

You type romanized Chinese (Pinyin for Mandarin, Jyutping for Cantonese) on a
standard keyboard. Yune converts it to the right Chinese characters in real time.

Under the hood, Yune reads RIME-style dictionary and configuration files for its
named targets and supported common-schema behavior. The goal is predictable
compatibility with existing RIME schemas when a target has oracle evidence, not
a universal all-schema claim.

**[yune-web.pages.dev](https://yune-web.pages.dev)** — try it in your browser.

### Capabilities

- RIME schema and config handling: `__include`, `__patch`, custom patches, deploy
  freshness, schema installation, and schema switching.
- Full input pipeline: speller, selector, navigator, key binder, editor, ASCII
  composer, chord composer, punctuation, recognizer, translators, and filters.
- Dictionary support: source `.dict.yaml`, imports, Yune-native compiled
  table/prism/reverse artifacts, rebuild execution, and fixture-backed ranking
  verified against the reference engine.
- C ABI compatibility: upstream-shaped default `RimeApi` and `RimeLeversApi`,
  config/context/candidate/session/deploy APIs, dynamic-loader tests, and
  frontend lifecycle tests.
- TypeDuck profile behavior: fork-only ABI slots exposed through
  `rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()`, rich Cantonese dictionary comments,
  TypeDuck-Web browser evidence, and TypeDuck-Windows backend/profile/IPC smoke
  evidence.
- Browser runtime: `@yune-ime/yune-web-runtime`, the `yune-web` Vite app,
  multi-schema browser harness (jyut6ping3, cangjie5, luna_pinyin, and more),
  UI language switching, output standard selection, public demo, and Playwright
  evidence.
- AI foundation: provider trait, local/mock providers, staged AI rows, privacy
  policy, separate AI memory, and default-off browser exposure.

## Why It Exists

RIME has been the backbone of open-source Chinese input for over a decade. It
works well. But it's a large C++ codebase that's difficult to change, test, or
embed in modern environments like browsers and mobile apps.

Yune rebuilds the engine from scratch in Rust with three goals:

**Run everywhere.** The same core engine can be exposed as a native
librime-shaped shared library for desktop host experiments, as WebAssembly for
browser-based input, or as a CLI tool for testing and benchmarking.

**Be testable.** Covered behavior is verified byte-for-byte against the relevant
RIME-family oracle. Instead of porting C++ code (and inheriting its bugs and
assumptions), Yune runs the oracle as a behavior reference: capture what it
outputs for a given input, then assert Yune produces the exact same result. This
preserves compatibility without cargo-culting a 15-year-old C++ architecture.

**Prepare for AI-native input.** The engine has a built-in, default-off AI layer.
In the future, an on-device language model could suggest completions or
corrections alongside traditional dictionary candidates — without slowing down
the classic path and without sending your typing to a cloud service.

## How It Works

```
keystrokes  ──►  spelling algebra  ──►  dictionary lookup  ──►  ranking & filtering  ──►  commit text
                    (normalize)          (find candidates)        (sort, deduplicate)        (output)
```

The pipeline is built from swappable Rust traits — translators, filters, and
rankers — rather than a monolithic class hierarchy. Want to plug in a custom
ranking model? Implement a trait. Want a different dictionary format? Swap the
translator.

The deterministic core is safe Rust. The workspace forbids unsafe code by
default, with explicit ABI/FFI exceptions in `yune-rime-api` and `yune-cli`.

## Current Status

Yune is an active engine project.

- **Compatibility baseline:** Phase 1 is complete. Yune matches its oracle on
  the captured fixture suites for each named target: Mandarin `luna_pinyin`
  against upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0`, and Cantonese `jyut6ping3` against
  TypeDuck-HK/librime `v1.1.2` through the TypeDuck profile. The M55 expanded
  oracle sentence fixtures also surfaced known, recorded gaps: Yune's first
  candidate page currently differs from librime on some single-letter
  completion rankings and some long-sentence top candidates (13 named blocked
  fixture rows) — these are disclosed, guarded correctness debt, not silent
  drift. `yune-web` has real in-browser validation (TypeDuck-Web); the
  TypeDuck-Windows backend has package/header, profile-ABI, and stock
  real-server IPC compatibility smoke through the named profile accessor,
  while interactive TSF typing and visible candidate UI remain Phase 2
  product/frontend work.
- **Current work:** milestones M38-M55 are complete, with M55 closed under a
  2026-07-04 corrective re-baseline: the benchmark now reads context after
  every keypress (the interactive shape), three pre-corrective closeout
  mechanisms were identified as measurement artifacts and reverted, and the
  standing regression gate (startup, session, eight Track A key rows, Track A
  peak memory, win rows locked `<1.00x`, TypeDuck Track B absolutes) is green
  twice on the honest metric. This is a lane-specific bounded-gap result, not
  a blanket claim that any row set is faster than librime.
- **Public demo:** `yune-web` is deployed at <https://yune-web.pages.dev>. It's
  a Yune engine demo, not a claim that browser-level performance is solved.
- **AI posture:** the AI layer exists but is default-off, local-only in the web
  harness, and outside the classic deterministic input path.

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for the detailed milestone plan.

## Compatibility

Yune's compatibility is target-driven, not checklist-driven.

**Reference engines** (the "oracles" that define correct behavior):

- Default core oracle: upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0`
  (`33e78140250125871856cdc5b42ddc6a5fcd3cd4`).
- TypeDuck profile oracle: TypeDuck-HK/librime `v1.1.2`
  (`74cb52b78fb2411137a7643f6c8bc6517acfde69`).

**Rules:**

- Preserve upstream-observable behavior for named targets.
- Isolate TypeDuck fork behavior behind the TypeDuck profile surface.
- Add librime features only when a named target needs them.
- Keep expected bytes non-circular: always capture them from the relevant oracle,
  never derive them from Yune itself.

Default `rime_get_api()` remains upstream-shaped. TypeDuck fork-only ABI slots
are exposed exclusively through `rime_get_typeduck_profile_api()`.

## Performance

The current native comparison is mixed, honest, and intentionally measured
same-run against upstream `rime/librime 1.17.0`, with the context read after
**every keypress** (the shape real frontends have; earlier batch-shaped
numbers are not comparable and the pre-corrective M55 closeout numbers were
measurement artifacts — see
[the corrective record](docs/reports/evidence/m55-native-match-or-beat/corrective-2026-07-04/README.md)).
This is not a claim that every benchmark row ranks identically to librime or
that browser performance is solved.

![Yune vs librime native latency ratios across all input dimensions](docs/reports/evidence/dashboard-visuals-2026-07-04/native-track-a-latency-ratios.svg)

Current native Track A same-run ratios (M55 corrective gate run D, 2026-07-04;
lower is better):

- **Faster than librime:** startup `0.895x` and session `0.864x` (run-noisy),
  `zhongguo` `0.255x`, `cszysmsrsd` `0.381x`, and `zybfshmsru` `0.564x` —
  the three win rows are locked `<1.00x` in the standing gate.
- **Slower than librime, bounded and guarded:** the short keys `hao` `1.574x`
  (+9 us), `ni` `2.433x` (+25 us), `n` `2.636x` (+34 us) — tens of
  microseconds, imperceptible while typing — and the sentence rows: 37-char
  `1.913x` (+273 us) and 59-char `1.528x` (+352 us), both improved ~35% from
  the pre-M55 `3.05x`/`2.25x` by real graph-work reductions.
- **Memory:** the shipping default keeps the Luna poet payload on the heap
  (Track A peak `185.7 MB` vs librime peer `13.5 MB`) because the latency
  ceilings bind. The `YUNE-POET/2` byte-backed opt-in
  (`YUNE_POET_BYTE_BACKED=1`) measures `113.2 MB` with identical candidates
  but currently costs `4.6x`/`3.2x` on the sentence rows; porting the
  incremental sentence scratch to byte-backed storage is the named path to
  having both. The browser `luna_pinyin` gap (`64 MiB` vs My RIME `16 MiB`)
  is a separate lane. The Jyutping product path is **not** a like-for-like
  comparison (TypeDuck multilingual dictionary); M47 byte-backed the shipping
  keyboard profile to about `67 MB` working set / `22 MB` private.
- Track B TypeDuck-profile rows and browser startup are separate evidence lanes,
  not upstream-librime native comparisons.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Rust 1.76 or newer
- Node.js and npm (for the browser harness and TypeScript runtime)
- Emscripten (only if building the WASM artifact locally)

Build and test:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test --workspace
```

Feed keystrokes directly to the core engine:

```bash
cargo run -p yune-cli -- run "nihao "
```

Run against real RIME data through the full ABI path:

```bash
cargo run -p yune-cli -- frontend \
  --shared-data-dir ./path/to/rime-data \
  --user-data-dir ./tmp/yune-user \
  --schema luna_pinyin \
  --sequence "nihao "
```

Run the browser demo locally:

```bash
npm --prefix apps/yune-web install
npm --prefix apps/yune-web run build
npm --prefix apps/yune-web run start
```

For browser validation work, start with
[apps/yune-web/e2e/yune-browser-smoke.md](apps/yune-web/e2e/yune-browser-smoke.md).

## Quality Checks

Run these before merging significant changes:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
npm --prefix packages/yune-web-runtime test
npm --prefix packages/yune-web-runtime run build
```

Browser-visible claims need Playwright or equivalent real-browser evidence.

## Non-Goals

Equally important as the goals — these are things Yune intentionally does not do:

- Bit-for-bit librime internals or full C++ plugin ABI parity.
- A broad librime feature checklist without a named target.
- Widening the default upstream `RimeApi` for TypeDuck-only behavior.
- Cloud inference as a hard dependency.
- Remote AI providers without explicit privacy and product gates.
- Claiming application/browser performance wins from native engine evidence.

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature proposals, and pull requests are welcome. For anything that
affects behavioral compatibility, include oracle-captured evidence (real RIME
output against the same input — expected values must not be derived from Yune
itself). Start with [docs/conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) for architecture
and coding rules.
